There are so many variants of Qwen models

- **Qwen2.5-Max** is the most powerful language model in the Qwen series. It achieves excellent performance in complex reasoning, instruction following, mathematics, coding, role-playing, creative writing, etc.
- **Qwen2.5-Plus** is the flagship language model of the Qwen series. It is capable of solving complex tasks, such as coding and mathematics, and it can achieve superior performance in language understanding and generation.
- **Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct** is the largest vision-language model in the open-source Qwen2.5 series. It can understand images and videos, generate image captions, answer questions, perform text recognition, detect objects, and more.
- **Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M** is an opensource long-context language model of the Qwen series. It is capable of common language tasks, such as summarization, translation, paraphrasing, reading comprehension, etc. Notably, it supports super long context of up to 1 million tokens.
- **QVQ-72B-Preview** is the experimental version of our visual reasoning model. It is based on Qwen2-VL-72B, and it is capable of long chain-of-thought thinking on the visual context.
- **QwQ-32B-Preview** is the experimental version of our reasoning model. It is based on Qwen2.5-32B, and it is capable of long chain-of-thought thinking, and it is especially good at coding, math, and simple logical reasoning.
- **Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct** is our opensourced flagship coder model. It demonstrates top-tier performance in coding.
- **Qwen2.5-Turbo** is a fast and long-context language model of the Qwen series. It is capable of common language tasks, such as summarization, translation, paraphrasing, reading comprehension, etc. Notably, it supports super long context of up to 1 million tokens.
- **Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct** is the largest language model the opensourced Qwen2.5 series. It achieves top-tier performance across downstream tasks, including language understanding, coding, math, multilingual tasks, etc.
